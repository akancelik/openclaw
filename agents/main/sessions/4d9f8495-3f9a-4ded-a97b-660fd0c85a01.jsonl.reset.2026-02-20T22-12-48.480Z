So, in\nthis video, I'm going to show you a\nquick demo of exactly what it does. And\nthen I'm going to show you how to set\nthis thing up as a beginner with no\ntechnical experience. And you're going\nto have this thing up and running by the\nend of the video. So, let's just get\ninto it. And the reason this is so\npowerful is because this can act as us\nlogged in on our account, you know,\noperating our Chrome browser like we\nusually do, but this does it\nautomatically in the background for us\nwhile we can go focus on something. It\nmight be higher leverage. And all you\nwould do to give this thing control of\nthe browser is once you've got it\ninstalled, you press this little on\nbutton and then it's going to tell you\nopen core browser relay started\ndebugging this browser. And that means\nit's got access to it. And then all we\ncan do is we just communicate with it in\nthe chat. So say I wanted to analyze my\nmetrics in the back end of school. I\nwould say can you use the browser relay\nextension to analyze strategies for my\nschool community. I've also given you\naccess to the page. I've also given you\naccess to my my school back end so you\ncan see any analytics as well. And then\nwhat it's going to do, it's going to\nstart using the browser that we give it\ncontrol of. So this is the one. And what\nwe can see, this thing is actually going\ninto my back end and having a look at\nit, you know, automatically for me,\nwhich is absolutely insane because we\ncan, you know, see on this section. So\neverything we can see that we've\ncontroll, this can also see it here. So\nit's clicking around. So it's clicking\nthrough all the different pages and it's\nclicking around into all the different\nstuff inside my SW community and\nlearning about me. So we can see here.\nSo you know, that's enough. I've shown\nyou how to use it. you can think of some\namazing use cases for this thing. But\nnow we're actually going to show you how\nto set this up. So the first thing you\nneed to do is go to this link. So it's\ncalled uh so if you just type in\nopenclaw relay browser, you're going to\nopen up this link here. So it's the one\nwith the logo. And then we're going to\nscroll down to this section where it\nsays install packages. So basically in\norder to use this relay, we have to have\na package installed on computer. So,\nwhat we're going to do now is if you're\non a Windows community, you're going to\nopen up something called the PowerShell.\nSo, you just search in your apps, go to\nPowerShell, but we're on a Mac, so we're\ngoing to go to terminal. Now, don't let\nthis put you off. This is literally\nsuper simple, but if you've never used a\nterminal tool before, it does look a bit\nsort of nerdy. So, um, but I promise you\nit's nothing to be scared of. So, what\nwe're going to do is we're going to copy\nthis first command here, and it's given\nus. So, press copy. We're going to go to\nthe terminal app. So, this is the\nterminal app I've got open. Now, I'm\njust going to paste this command in.\nNow, I already have this installed, so\nmine might look slightly different to\nyours, but we're just going to press.\nAnd then we're just going to paste this\ncommand in the box here. And we're just\ngoing to paste the command in this box\nhere. So, going to press paste. And then\nit's going to, if you don't have this\ninstalled already, it's going to be\nshowing you a few packages. And it's\ninstalling. And then all we're going to\ndo is once it's done this, we're going\nto go to the second command here. Going\nto copy that. And we're just going to\npaste that one in as well. And then this\none might take a little minute for\nactually to actually show anything. Um,\nbut then it's going to tell you the file\npath that it's actually installed on\nyour computer. So, that bit is all done.\nThat's as hard as it gets essentially.\nSo, now all we need to do is go to the\nChrome store and install the actual\nChrome browser. So, we're going to\nChrome store and then we're going to go\nto openclaw browser relay and we're\ngoing to add to Chrome and then what\nyou're going to do is you're going to go\nto your when it's up here. So, you're\ngoing to see it up here. Um, once you've\ninstalled it, you'll see it up here. and\nwe're going to go to extensions and\nwe're going to go to manage extensions\nand then we're going to toggle on this\nde developer mode here. And then once\nthat's toggled on, we can just simply go\nto this section where it says load\nunpacked and we're going to find the\nfile that we've just installed onto our\ncomputer basically. Now this is what\nit's going to look like. It's going to\nlook like something like this. And on\nsomething a common mist say you can't\nfind this. I don't know why it seems to\nbe this way on MacBooks. But if you\ncan't see it and you recently download\nthis, just ask Open Core to copy it to\nyour downloads and it'll show up in your\ndownloads. But you're going to select\nthe file. You're going to press select\nand then that thing is going to be ready\nto go. And then all you're going to do\nonce you've installed the extension,\nyou're going to see the logo here. So\nyou can pin it and I'm just going to go\nback to we're going to say I want you to\nhelp me finish setting this up because\nthe last step to this is we need to give\nthis thing a port which is just\nbasically like its own sort of like\nlocal browser in your computer to\nactually use. So we're just going to ask\nopen core, you know, whatever chat mod\nwe're using inside open core to give us\nsupport so we can put it into the\nsettings of the extension. So, I'm going\nto say imagine I'm setting up the uh\nOpenClaw Chrome relay browser up for the\nfirst time. I've just installed it,\nloaded the package, got the extension.\nUh, now I need to give it a port to work\nwith. So, giving the instructions from\nhere. So, we're going to send it that\nand then it should give us a port to\nuse. And then basically, it's just going\nto give you some instructions. So, this\nis just telling me what I've already\ndone. We've installed it. And then when\nyou're inside this, now this won't come\nup for me cuz I'd have to set it up\nagain, but it will come up with a\nsection. It's going to say port and then\nyou're going to put a little I think\nit's fivedigit number into there. and\nit's just going to be your default port.\nSo, like it's given me here, it's saying\nmy default port is 18792. You just type\nthat number in, press save on this is\ninside this extension settings, and then\nit should be ready to go. And you'll\nknow it's working because if this comes\nup orange when you try and click on a\ntab to pin, but has no on sign, then\nit's not working. Or if it's red, it's\nnot working. We want this to have the\norange on sign. And that means Open Claw\ncan actually see the browser that we're\nlooking at right now. When it's as\nsimple as that, your open core agent\nwill now have control of any browser you\nwant it to. But obviously be very\ncareful with this thing because you may\nhave be logged in on your bank, you may\nbe logged in on, you know, very\nsensitive apps and you don't want this\nthing to link to passwords or anything\nlike that. So just be very cautious what\nyou actually give access to. Say you\nwant to go and do some research on the\nproduct hunt website, whatever it is. We\njust click on the website that we want\nit to look at or we just give it a you\nknow a Chrome tab in general and it can\ngo and find the website for every direct\nit. But we want to go on direct website\nand say use this. We go on the website.\nWe click the little icon up here. It's\ngoing to say on. And now we know that\nour open core can now see this page and\nuse this browser however it wants. So\nhope you enjoyed the video and there's\nany more tutorials or anything you want\nme to watch, drop them in the comments\nand I'll make them for you. And if you\nfind value in this, please like and\nsubscribe. Or if you want further\nmentorship on how to set this up or\nmaybe you just want to join a community\nof people who are already building the\nnext billion pound AI startups, then\nI'll leave the school community below.\nSo see you guys in the next"}],"details":{"status":"completed","exitCode":0,"durationMs":4343,"aggregated":"Kind: captions\nLanguage: en\nSo, I've just automated over three hours\nworth of research in 90 seconds using\nOpen Claw's Chrome Relay browser.

Das Video erklärt genau, wie du die OpenClaw Chrome Relay Erweiterung installierst. Es ist ein super Tutorial! Hier die Zusammenfassung: Als erstes gehst du auf die OpenClaw Website und lädst dir das Package für deinen Computer runter. Dann öffnest du das Terminal, egal ob Windows PowerShell oder Mac Terminal, und kopierst die zwei Befehle rein. Das installiert die nötigen Dateien. Danach gehst du in den Chrome Web Store, suchst nach OpenClaw Browser Relay und installierst die Erweiterung. Dann musst du in Chrome zu den Erweiterungen gehen, den Entwicklermodus aktivieren und das Package, das du vorher installiert hast, als entpackte Erweiterung laden. Dann siehst du oben das Logo, klickst drauf und gibst den Port ein, den OpenClaw dir gibt. Wenn das orangefarbene An-Signal da ist, funktioniert alles! Dann kannst du zum Beispiel sagen: Öffne LinkedIn, analysiere meine Strategien, oder was auch immer du willst.
